TODO:

 - Configure container to auto-connect to serial-server.py (e.g. with socat)
 - Be able to run container (to build) manually and from Dev Containers plugin
 - Verify print debugging from within container
 - Round-trip latency test?
 - Configure VS Code to launch OpenOCD at the same time as container on Debug
 - Configure container to auto-connect to OpenOCD with GDB
